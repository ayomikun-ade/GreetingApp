# Personalized Greeting App

Welcome to the Personalized Greeting App! This simple web application allows users to input their name and receive a personalized greeting. The user's name is stored in the local storage, ensuring that the greeting persists even if the page is refreshed.

## Features

1. **Name Input:**
   - Display a form with a text input prompting the user to enter their name.
   - Use DOM Manipulation to capture the entered name when the form is submitted.

2. **Store Name in Local Storage:**
   - When the user submits their name, the application stores it in the local storage.

3. **Display Personalized Greeting:**
   - On page load, the app checks if the user's name is stored in local storage.
   - If the name is found, it displays a personalized greeting. If not, it shows a generic greeting.

4. **Clear Name:**
   - Provide a button to clear the stored name and reset the greeting message.
